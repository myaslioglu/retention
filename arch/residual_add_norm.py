class ResidualAddNorm(nn.Module):
    """
    Applies residual addition followed by layer normalization.

    This module is designed to perform a residual connection operation by
    adding an input tensor (residual) to a sublayer output tensor. The
    resultant tensor is then normalized using layer normalization.

    The normalization is implemented using PyTorch's `nn.LayerNorm`, which
    provides an option to use learned affine parameters (scale and bias). The
    epsilon parameter ensures numerical stability during normalization.

        the combined residual and sublayer output.

        The class creates a LayerNorm instance from the PyTorch nn module. It provides
