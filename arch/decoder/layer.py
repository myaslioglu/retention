        Initializes a decoder layer consisting of masked multi-head attention, cross-multi-head
        attention, feed-forward network, and corresponding residual normalization components.

        The decoder layer uses the provided hyperparameters to define each sublayer:
        masked multi-head attention, which is commonly used in a decoder's
        self-attention mechanism, cross-multi-head attention, which integrates encoder
        information, and a feed-forward layer for additional processing. Each component is
        followed by residual connections and layer normalization.

            sublayer within the decoder.

        :param dropout_pe: Dropout probability to be applied to internal operations
            such as attention computations and feed-forward layers.

            network.

            the attention mechanism. If not provided, it will default to a value
